    Loop inside another loop (Nested Loops)
    It is also possible to place a loop inside another loop. This is called a
    Nested Loop.
    The ‚Äúinner loop‚Äù will be executed one time for each iteration of the
    ‚Äúouter loop‚Äù

üß† Summary: Nested Loops in C++
--------------------------------------------------------------

üìå A loop inside another loop is called a nested loop.
    ‚û§ Outer loop controls rows.
    ‚û§ Inner loop controls columns or elements within the row.

‚úÖ Example Pattern for rows = 4:
    *
    * *
    * * *
    * * * *

üí° Nested loops are commonly used for patterns, matrices, and 2D problems.
